# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
It is a Natural Language Processing Problem where Sentiment Analysis is done by classifying tweets into positive or negative sentiments using machine learning models for classification, text mining, text analysis, data analysis, and data visualization.

# Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a flourishing field in data science today, and sentiment analysis stands out as one of its most prevalent applications. From market research to customer feedback analysis, sentiment analysis has revolutionized decision-making processes across industries. It's a domain every data scientist should be well-versed in.

Processing thousands of text documents for sentiment analysis can now be done in seconds, a task that would take hours for a team of individuals to complete manually.

We'll embark on a journey to tackle a sentiment analysis problem, beginning with preprocessing and cleaning of raw tweet text. We'll then dive into exploring the cleaned text, gaining insights into the sentiment conveyed by the tweets. Next, we'll extract numerical features from the data and employ these feature sets to train models for sentiment classification.

This journey promises to be one of the most intriguing challenges in NLP, and I'm thrilled to have you accompany me!

# Understand the Problem Statement

Before delving into the technical aspects, let's dissect the problem statement. The objective of this task is to discern the sentiment of tweets. Unlike previous endeavors focusing on controversial topics, our goal now is to classify tweets as either positive or negative based on their sentiment.

Formally, given a training sample of tweets and corresponding labels, where label '1' denotes a positive sentiment and label '0' denotes a negative sentiment, our aim is to predict the sentiments of tweets in the test dataset.

# Tweets Preprocessing and Cleaning

Imagine searching for a document in a cluttered versus an organized office space. Which scenario would facilitate finding the document more easily? Certainly, the less cluttered one, where each item is in its proper place. Similarly, data cleaning aims to organize and structure the data, making it conducive for analysis.

Preprocessing of text data is essential as it prepares raw text for analysis, making it easier to extract information and apply machine learning algorithms. By eliminating noise such as punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant terms, we enhance the quality of our data and subsequent analysis.

# Story Generation and Visualization from Tweets

In this section, we embark on an exploration of cleaned tweet text. Exploring and visualizing data is a crucial step in gaining insights. Let's not confine ourselves to predefined methods; instead, let's explore the data to its fullest extent.

Before we delve into exploration, let's pose some pertinent questions:
- What are the most common words in the entire dataset?
- What are the most common words in the dataset for negative and positive tweets, respectively?
- How many hashtags are there in a tweet?
- What trends are associated with our dataset?
- Are there trends associated with either sentiment? Do they align with the sentiments?

# End Notes

In this article, we delved into the intricacies of sentiment analysis, from preprocessing and exploration of data to feature extraction using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF. We then utilized these features to build models for tweet classification.
